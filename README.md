After login or signup, users are redirected to their profile page, where they can:

Enter their first name and last name.
Update or edit their profile details anytime.
Once changes are saved, the user is redirected to the main page.

The main page offers two options:
1️⃣ Direct Messaging:
Users can select a contact and start messaging.
They can send emojis, files, and photos for a more interactive chat experience.

2️⃣ Channels:
Users can create channels for group conversations.
Channels allow multiple users to collaborate and communicate in real-time.
